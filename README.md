# Multi-Sensor-Data-Acquisition-with-Wi-Fi-Streaming
This project creates a smart sensor system. It uses various sensors to 
gather information about the environment, such as temperature, 
humidity, light, and movement. The collected data is then sent 
wirelessly over Wi-Fi to a computer or another device. 

Components Used 
ESP 32, DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor, IR Sensor,      
MPU6050 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Wifi Module.
